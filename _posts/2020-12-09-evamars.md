introduction: EvaMars is a Mars mission training robot developed by Inovasyon Mühendislik for UPlat virtual laboratory.  It is modeled to be able to perform exploration missions in the Martian environment, conduct drilling works, and move in the harsh terrain of the environment. A possible Mars exploration scenario was created by means of EvaMars and robotics training packages were revealed with this scenario.

EvaMars is a Mars mission training robot developed by Inovasyon Mühendislik for UPlat (theuplat.com) virtual laboratory.  It is modeled to be able to perform exploration missions in the Martian environment, conduct drilling works, and move in the harsh terrain of the environment. A possible Mars exploration scenario was created by means of EvaMars and robotics training packages were revealed with this scenario.

### Robot's Details
* Drilling System: Eva-Mars Robot has a drilling system with 3 nested cylinders. The system, which has a piercing tip that can go down to a depth of 15 cm from the surface, is designed to simulate drilling activity scenarios on the Martian surface.
* 6-Wheel Movement: Eva-Mars Robot has 6 wheel drive wheels that can move easily on rough terrain on Mars surface.
* Depth and RGB Camera: Depth and RGB Camera, the eye of the Eva-Mars Robot on Mars, has been integrated for simulations of Mars exploration missions thanks to both RGB image and depth perception. The robot gains a 360-degree perspective, thanks to the rotating port on which the camera is attached.
